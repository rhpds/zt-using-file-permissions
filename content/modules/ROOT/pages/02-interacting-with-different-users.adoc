=== Interacting with a file from different user accounts

Recall from the previous step that *status.sh* has the following
permissions:

.Output
[source,text]
----
-rwxr-x---
----

Therefore, *root* has permission to execute this script. Run the script
by copying and pasting the following into the terminal window.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
./status.sh
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
status.sh successfully executed by root
----

Let’s focus on the permissions of `*status.sh*`.

The first three letters of the access mode show that the owner of the
file has full permissions, *rwx*, so the owner can read, write, and
execute this file. See the image below.

Users in the group that owns this file have *r-x*, so they can read and
execute but cannot write to this file. See the image below.

Finally, all other users have no permissions, *—*, so they are unable to
read, write, or execute this file.

Switch to the `*>_rhel*` tab and traverse into the `*/srv*` directory.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
cd /srv
----

This command has no expected output.

Try executing the status script as *rhel*. Since the rhel account is
not the user owner of the file and is not part of any owner groups, you
are unable to execute this script from this user account.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
./status.sh
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
-bash: ./status.sh: Permission denied
----

Now that you know how files behave differently when operated on by
different user accounts, the next steps will show you how to customize
permissions to control this behavior.
