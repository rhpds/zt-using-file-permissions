From the *Root tab* confirm that *root* is the initial owner of the file
*tasks.txt*:

[source,bash]
----
ls -l tasks.txt
----

The third and fourth column of this output are the user and group that
own the file. Right now, *root* is the owner in both cases.

Switch to the guest terminal in the bottom pane and attempt to read the
file:

[source,bash]
----
cat tasks.txt
----

This read operation is denied, as *guest* does not have read permission.

Return to the *Root tab*.

Change the user that owns *tasks.txt* to *guest*:

[source,bash]
----
chown guest tasks.txt
----

Return to the *Guest tab*.

Run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
ls -l tasks.txt
----

Now that *guest* owns the file instead of *root*, this user has
permission to read the file without reconfiguring the access modes.

[source,bash]
----
cat tasks.txt
----

The fourth column of the `+ls -l+` output is the group which owns the
file. The next step will walk you through changing group ownership.
