It is important to properly assign permissions to files and directories
created on a shared system so that files are not accidentally (or
maliciously) tampered with, destroyed, or executed. The next section
shows you how to view the permissions of files in an example directory.

== Displaying files and their permissions

There are two tabs in the web interface. Click on the tab labelled
`+Root+`.

For this lab, several files have been created for you to work with in
the `+/srv+` directory. Use the `+cd+` command to navigate there:

[source,bash]
----
cd /srv
----

The command `+ls -l+` can be used to look at the permissions associated
with each file in the directory. The output for this can be cryptic at
first, so this step will walk you through what each character means.
Take a look at the contents of the current directory. Use the long
listing option (`+-l+`) to display information about permissions for
each item.

[source,bash]
----
ls -l
----

Let’s look a bit closer at the permissions.

The first column of the output above is a string conveying the access
mode. The access mode *-rwxr-x—*, seen here for the *status.sh* file,
conveys the following information:

string breakdown]

The middle columns of the `+ls+` output give information about the user
ownership and group ownership of the files, their size, the time last
modified, and finally the file/directory name itself. The next steps
will walk you through the importance of the file ownership fields.
