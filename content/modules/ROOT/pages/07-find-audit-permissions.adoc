=== Changing Group Ownership

Changing group ownership can be much more efficient than manually assigning owners,
when there are many users that should have the same access to a file.

Group ownership can be changed with the `*chgrp*` command by adding a
colon before the name of the group.

Return to the *>_ root* tab.

Change the group permission of the *tasks.txt* file:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
chgrp team tasks.txt
----

This command has no expected output.

Verify the change using `*ls -l*`:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
ls -l tasks.txt
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
-rwxr-x---. 1 rhel team 117 Mar  5 23:01 tasks.txt
----

This change is reflected in the fourth column of the `*ls -l*` output,
which now says *team* instead of *root*.

NOTE: Some people prefer the `*chgrp*` command for changing groups as it has identical syntax to `*chown*`, you do not have to add a colon when using `*chgrp*`. Others prefer to use `*chown*` with the colon as above so that they do not have to remember two different commands.

The final step in this lab will walk you through using `*find*` to
locate any files that may have their permissions configured incorrectly.
