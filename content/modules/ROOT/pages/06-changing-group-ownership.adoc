Group ownership can be changed with the `+chgrp+` command by adding a
colon before the name of the group.

Return to the *Root tab*.

Change the group permission of the *tasks.txt* file:

[source,bash]
----
chown :team tasks.txt
----

Verify the change using `+ls -l+`:

[source,bash]
----
ls -l tasks.txt
----

This change is reflected in the fourth column of the `+ls -l+` output,
which now says *team* instead of *root*.

____
_NOTE:_ Some people prefer the `+chgrp+` command for changing groups as
it has identical syntax to `+chown+`, you do not have to add a colon
when using `+chgrp+`. Others prefer to use `+chown+` with the colon as
above so that they do not have to remember two different commands.

The final step in this lab will walk you through using `+find+` to
locate any files that may have their permissions configured incorrectly.
