=== The chmod Command

The chmod command is how you modify the permissions associated with files and directories.
The chmod command has two different ways to modify permissions: symbolic and absolute.

Symbolic permissions have the same format as the access mode output of `ls -l`.
In this mode, you use the characters r, w, and x to set the read, write, and execute permissions.

The other mode, absolute, instead uses a series of three numbers to correspond to
the permissions for the owner, group, and others. These numbers are identical in
meaning to the symbolic mode breakdown, they are just more compact and therefore quicker to type.
Here is an example of how the two modes relate from Boolean World:

NOTE: This image refers to absolute mode as numeric mode. These two terms are interchangeable and you will commonly see both.

The crucial takeaway is that each character in a symbolic permission can be converted to a binary number, 1 if the user has that permission and 0 if the user does not. These three binary numbers become a single octal digit, and three such octal digits compose an absolute representation of the file's permissions.

The upcoming sections walk through a examples of changing permissions using each of these two modes.
