The owner user and owner group will have full permissions, but others
will only be able to read the file.

Return to *Root tab*.

Use `+chmod+` to modify the permissions on *status.sh* as previously
discussed.

[source,bash]
----
chmod 774 status.sh
----

Confirm that this change has succeeded by checking the access mode for
*status.sh*

[source,bash]
----
ls -l status.sh
----

Go back to the *Guest tab*.

Verify that you do not have permission to execute the status script as
*guest*:

[source,bash]
----
./status.sh
----

.denied!
image::../assets/absolutepermissionchangedenied.png[denied!]

However, if you try to read this file, you will see you do have read
access as *guest*:

[source,bash]
----
cat status.sh
----

.readable
image::../assets/readable.png[readable]

____
_NOTE:_ You can use `+vi+` or any other write command to verify that you
do not have write access as *guest* if you wish to verify this as well.
____

Many users default to absolute permissions because of how much quicker
they are to type. If you are still unsure exactly what these commands
are doing, please check out the "`How do I manage permissions?`" section
of https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/manage-permissions[this Enable
Sysadmin article] to learn more.

The next step will walk you through changing which user owns a file.
